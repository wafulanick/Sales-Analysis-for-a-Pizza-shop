**THIS IS HOW I ARRIVED AT THE FIGURES ON THE DASHBOARD ABOVE USING POSTGRESQL**
**#THE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS **
To arrive at this KPIs, I did the querying using PostgreSQL to act as my point of reference for accuracy nefore going ahead and working on the same in Power BI by creating measures to make visualization easy.
The KPIs include:

- Total Revenue

**INSIGHT  GENERATED**
The total revenue generated for the year stood at $817,860. From the Analysis, the most vibrant days upon which majority of the sales hapen are betwwen Thursday and Saturday. This is showcased by the Daily trand bar chart, with Thursday showing 3239 sales, Friday showing 3538 sales, and Saturday showing 3158 sales. Additionally, the most vibrant times according to the Hourly trend are betwwen 12pm and 1pm and also between 5pm and 6pm.

**RECOMMENDATION**
Therefore, according to this insigths drawn, the business oughts to maximize the sales of these 3 days leading to the weekend, and also the most active times of the day to see maximum sales are made. However, we can introduce marketing and promotional activities for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday since they show potential of breaching the 3000 sales mark.
